    <h1>My top 3 videogames of all-time.</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Mass Effect</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite 3D action RPG of all time, there is no other else epic than Commander Shepard saving the universe from the Reapers.</p>

    <h3>Dark Souls 2</h3>
    <p>Even though it is getting many hate by people, I really love the world in dark souls 2. Also with its perks that it can run on a potato PC or laptop. Awesome style of combat here is the class Sorcerer with many spells and cool effects appearing at the end of your staves.</p>

    <h3>Starcraft</h3>
    <p>Has a similarity with Mass Effect, but one of the most memorable Real-Time Strategy game (RTS). 3 races, fighting each other for survival, politics, and for love. What else you could ask for more?</p>
